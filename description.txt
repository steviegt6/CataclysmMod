1.1.1.0 finally fixed issues with Mac & Linux.

1.1.0.0 overhauled the mod's internal code and made many changes, allowing Cataclysm to no longer be a Calamity-only add-on.

Current features (subject to change!):
 Calamity:
 * Obsidian Skull and its subsidaries provide heat resistance.
 * The Sponeg and The Absorber have the effects of the Rover Drive.
 * Infinity no longer consumes ammo, but suffers from a slightly DPS decrease as a result.
 * Spider Armor provides more defense and lets you stick to walls.
 * Added the Sulphurous (Sulfrous) Shell, which allows you to teleport to the Sulphurous Sea (obtained from Abyssal Crates).
 * Clother and Guide Voodoo dolls have an increased max stack of 20.
 * Basher is 1.2 times larger.
 * Sulphurskin Potions sell for 2 silver.
 * The Rampart of Deities and Deific Amulet provide the same life regeneration as the Heart Band.
 * Some changes to Mysterious Circuitry and Dubious Plating drops.
 * Clingers drop a new item called the Dagger of Decree, which is a new legendary rogue item.
 * The Travelling Merchant may now drop the Pulse Bow on death.
 * Frogfish, Catfish, Devil Fish, Fusion Feeders, and Sunskaters can drop shark fins.
 * Angry Dogs have an increased span rate and a higher change to drop the Cryophobia.
 * Great Sand Sharks drop a new item called the Grand Shark Repellent, which can prevent the Great Sand Shark from spawning.
 * Enemies will specify their organic status (Organic or Inorganic) once hit.
 * The Wizard will now sell the Guide Voodoo Doll.
 * Numerous different minions now rotate as they move. Looks cool and gud.
 * Dratliornus' arrows pass throw blocks.
 * Fungal Clump now emits light.
 * Slime God's abyss mines despawn once the Slime God has been defeated.
 * Lore items remain activated if placed in a piggy bank (Lore items will be re-added by Cataclysm once they are removed in Calamity 1.5!).
 * Cavern shrines are made out of stone and stone bricks instead of obsidian.
 * Slime God inflicts slimed so you don't become unable to move up and down lmaoooo.
 * Torrential Tear doesn't make it rain like a tsunami is above you or some crap.
 * Throwing Bricks are crafted at a work bench instead of an anvil.
 * Halley's Inferno is crafted with a Rifle Scope instead of Sniper Scope.

 Thorium:
 * Stained Glass sells for 5 silver like vanilla stained glass.
 * Doubled Globee spawn rate. :)

Clicker Class:
 * Added several new clicker weapons, still a heavy work-in-progress.

Split:
 * The Umbrella can now block Menace's icicle knife and Tetris ice block attacks.
 * Added the Pharaoh's Fear, an Ankh Shield and Terror Shield upgrade.

Some of these mods are more lacking than others, but I'll get around to adding more content soon!
